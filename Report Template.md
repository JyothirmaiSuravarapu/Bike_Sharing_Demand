# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
When trying to submit predictions, I realized that the predictions generated by the predictor contained negative values, which are not valid for the target variable in this regression problem. To fix this issue, I set all negative predictions to zero before submitting the results. This ensures that the predictions are within the valid range for the target variable and can be submitted without any errors.

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
The top-ranked model that performed was the one trained with hyperparameters optimized (`submission_new_hpo.csv`). It achieved the highest public and private scores among the submissions listed in the table.

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
The exploratory analysis likely uncovered insights into the data's distributions and relationships. New features were created to capture additional patterns or characteristics. This could involve categorizing data, transforming features, or decomposing datetime features.

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
The improvement was not substantial, as the Kaggle scores remained relatively consistent across different model configurations. The added features likely provided some additional information to the model, allowing it to capture more nuances in the data. However, it's possible that the original features already contained most of the relevant information for predicting the target variable, so the impact of the additional features was limited.

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
After trying different hyperparameters, our model's performance exhibited a significant improvement. Initially, the model yielded a Kaggle score around 1.8, indicating a higher error rate in its predictions. However, after fine-tuning the hyperparameters, the Kaggle score dramatically dropped to approximately 0.4. This substantial decrease in the Kaggle score indicates an enhancement in performance, as lower scores denote better model accuracy. By systematically adjusting the hyperparameters, the model became more adept at capturing complex patterns in the data, resulting in more precise predictions. Consequently, this improvement enhances the model's utility and reliability in real-world applications, where accurate predictions are crucial for decision-making processes
### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
If I had more time with this dataset, I would primarily focus on feature engineering to extract more meaningful information from the available data. This involves diving deeper into the characteristics of the features and creating new ones that could better capture the underlying patterns in the data. By exploring different transformations, interactions, and aggregations of the existing features, I aim to uncover additional insights that can improve the model's predictive performance. Furthermore, incorporating domain knowledge and experimenting with advanced feature selection techniques could lead to the discovery of key predictors that are more relevant to the target variable. Ultimately, investing more time in feature engineering would enable me to build a more powerful and accurate predictive model for the task at hand.
